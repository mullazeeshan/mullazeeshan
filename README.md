My name is Mohammed Zeeshan Mulla and I am from Mumbai, India.

I'm a Data Science practitioner and computer programmer with an avid interest lies in applied machine learning and deep learning.

You can see what I am currently upto on [zeeshanmulla.me](http://www.zeeshanmulla.me/)

When in times of leisure, I like to read books in the genre of mystery, and self-help and varied interest for gaming or variety of sports. I am usually found pursuing a MooC or reading a book to gain knowledge about the stuff that I don't know or with the intention of deep diving into stuff that I already now.
